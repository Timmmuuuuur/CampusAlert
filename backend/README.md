# CampusAlert backend

## Set up
Pip requirement packages:
```
Django
django-debug-toolbar
django-rest-framework
firebase_admin
fcm-django
djangorestframework-jwt
django-extensions
django-simple-history
```

NOTE: there is a risk that installing firebase_admin can cause damage to the OpenSSL package in Python distro. See here on how to fix it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73830524/attributeerror-module-lib-has-no-attribute-x509-v-flag-cb-issuer-check

After that, you need to get the Firebase secret JSON file from the Discord server and put that somewhere on your computer. Then have your environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` point to it.

If you have Linux, Linux subsystem for Windows, or MacOS, you can do the following to add it to Bash:
```
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

Then add this line
```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL=<path to the JSON file>
```

Make sure to restart your terminal and you are in Bash and not zsh. zsh requires similar steps.

## Running + developing

To start the program, run

```py
python3 manage.py runserver 8080
```

Every time you update the field name or add new fields to a model, you MUST run this before committing!

```py
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
- and accept each rename correctly in the terminal prompts

Finally, go into `admin.py` and write

```py
admin.site.register(NameOfYourModel)
```

## DANGEROUS: Delete all data and migration

You might have to do this occassionally when Django is being super stubborn and refuse to migrate due to the data in your tables.

```py
python manage.py reset_db
```

After that, delete every Python file in `migrations` as well. Then follow the step above to makemigration and migrate.

### Create an admin account

```py
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You can ignore the warning about short password in development environment.

Kevin's admin account:
- username: thundertonic
- password: 123

# Path
## `auth`
`/auth/whoami`
- returns the user info

## `accounts`
- API is auto generated by Django

## `playground`

## `emergency`

## `__debug__`
- reserved for debugging purposes, auto generated by Django


# TODOs
