# CampusAlert
Welcome to CampusAlert. 
This is an app developed by Timur Dauletov, Eva Liu, Janko Strizak and Kevin Lee for our Final Year Design Project(FYDP) at UWaterloo. 
The app serves the purpose of making Campus users notified of any dangerous events(attackers, fires and  severe storms) that take place at any location on the UWaterloo campus.

We created this app after the incident that occurred in Hagey Hall in June 2024 in order to prevent such occurrences from happening without people knowing. Our event response time at the moment is nearly instantenous - and as of March 13th 2024, we've passed the tests of the FYDP Symposium team with flying colours. The details of the further deployment of our product are currently being discussed
